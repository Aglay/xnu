 * Channel ID related definitions.  These serve to denote the namespace of interrupt accounting in the
 * context of IOReporter-based clients.  Interrupt accounting distinguishes between interrupts based on
 * the nub the interrupt was registered relative to, and the nub relative interrupt index (i.e, the
 * namespace for interrupt accounting is {nub ID, interrupt index}).  IOReporting already knows about
 * nubs (in the context of IOService), however it has no built in knowledge of interrupt accounting.
 * As a result of this, it is the responsibility of the IOReporting client to request any desired
 * statistics on a per-index basis (i.e, if you want to get the first level interrupt count for all
 * interrupts, you must express an interest in the first level interrupt count statistic for index 0, 1,

<span class="enscript-comment">/*
 * This enum defines the basic statistics we gather for each interrupt.  Currently, the information
 * we gather falls into roughly three buckets: interrupt related (counts, times), scheduler related
 * (thread wakeups), and power related (package/cpu state changes).
 *
 * First Level Count: This represents the number of times that this interrupt has fired (more
 *   specifically, the number of times we have run the handler we expect to run in interrupt context).
 *
 * Second Level Count: This represents the number of times we have run any second level handler for
 *   this interrupt (more specifically, the handler we expect to be run in the regular kernel context).
 *
 * First Level Time: This represents the aggregate time spent running the first level handler.  For
 *   some interrupts, this value will be 0, as this is not meant to track time spent running generic
 *   IOKit code for the interrupt (i.e, IOInterruptEventSource code), but instead any custom code run
 *   at the interrupt context (i.e, the filter installed for an IOFilterInterruptEventSource).
 *
 * Second Level CPU Time: This represents the aggregate time spent actually running the second level
 *   handler on the CPU.  As the second level handler may block or be preempted, it is meaningful to
 *   distinguish this from the system time spent handling the interrupt.  As was the case for the
 *   first level handler, this does not attempt to track the time spent running generic IOKit code
 *   (i.e, IOInterruptEventSource code or IOWorkLoop code), but instead attempts to track the time
 *   spent running the handler that was installed.
 *
 * Second Level System Time: This represents the aggregate time spent in the second level handler;
 *   this will include time where the handler was blocked or had been preempted.  This should equate
 *   to the wall time spent handling an interrupt (as long as we don't allow the system to go to
 *   sleep while a second level handler is running).
 *
 * No Thread Wakeups: The number of times that the interrupt did not attempt to wake up a thread
 *   (typically the work loop for the interrupt source is woken up).
 *
 * Total Thread Wakeups: The aggregate number of threads (non-unique) woken up by the interrupt.
 *   If no threads were actually woken up for an interrupt (i.e, the work loop thread was already
 *   runnable), this value will not change.
 *
 * Package Wakeups: The number of times that this interrupt woke up the package (as defined by the
 *   scheduler).
 *
 * CPU Wakeups: The number of times that this interrupt woke up a CPU (forcing it to go through the
 *   reset path).
 *
 * Idle Exits: The number of times that this interrupt forced a CPU out of the idle loop (the CPU
 *   had to exit an idle state to handle the interrupt, but it did not need to go through the reset
 *   path).

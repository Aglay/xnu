 * Some hacks for compatibility across SunOS and 4.4BSD.  We emulate malloc
 * and free with mbuf clusters.  We store a pointer to the mbuf in the first
 * word of the mbuf and return 8 bytes passed the start of data (for double
 * word alignment).  We cannot just use offsets because clusters are not at
 * a fixed offset from the associated mbuf.  Sorry for this kludge.

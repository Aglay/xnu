.Sh NAME
.Nm udp
.Nd Internet User Datagram Protocol
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;
.Fd #include &lt;netinet/in.h&gt;
.Ft int
.Fn socket AF_INET SOCK_DGRAM 0
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Tn UDP
is a simple, unreliable datagram protocol which is used
to support the
.Dv SOCK_DGRAM
abstraction for the Internet
protocol family.
.Tn UDP
sockets are connectionless, and are
normally used with the
.Xr sendto
and
.Xr recvfrom
calls, though the
.Xr connect 2
or
.Xr connectx 2
call may also be used to fix the destination for future
packets (in which case the 
.Xr recv 2
or
.Xr read 2
and 
.Xr send 2
or
.Xr write 2
system calls may be used).
.Pp
.Tn UDP
address formats are identical to those used by
.Tn TCP .
In particular
.Tn UDP
provides a port identifier in addition
to the normal Internet address format.  Note that the
.Tn UDP
port
space is separate from the
.Tn TCP
port space (i.e. a
.Tn UDP
port
may not be
.Dq connected
to a
.Tn TCP
port).  In addition broadcast
packets may be sent (assuming the underlying network supports
this) by using a reserved
.Dq broadcast address ;
this address
is network interface dependent.
.Pp
Options at the
.Tn IP
transport level may be used with
.Tn UDP ;
see
.Xr ip 4 .
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
A socket operation may fail with one of the following errors returned:
.Bl -tag -width [EADDRNOTAVAIL]
.It Bq Er EISCONN
when trying to establish a connection on a socket which
already has one, or when trying to send a datagram with the destination
address specified and the socket is already connected;
.It Bq Er ENOTCONN
when trying to send a datagram, but
no destination address is specified, and the socket hasn't been
connected;
.It Bq Er ENOBUFS
when the system runs out of memory for
an internal data structure;
.It Bq Er EADDRINUSE
when an attempt
is made to create a socket with a port which has already been
allocated;
.It Bq Er EADDRNOTAVAIL
when an attempt is made to create a 
socket with a network address for which no network interface
exists.

.Dt CORE 5
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm core
.Nd memory image file format
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/param.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
A small number of signals which cause abnormal termination of a process
also cause a record of the process's in-core state to be written
to disk for later examination by one of the available debuggers.
(See
.Xr sigaction 2 . )
This memory image is written to a file named by default
.Pa core.pid ,
where
.Va pid
is the process ID of the process,
in the
.Pa /cores
directory,
provided the terminated process had write permission in the directory,
and the directory existed.
.Pp
The maximum size of a core file is limited by
.Xr setrlimit 2 .
Files which would be larger than the limit are not created.
.Pp
The core file consists of the
.Xr Mach-O 5
header as  described in the
.Aq Pa mach-o/loader.h
file.
The remainder of the core
file consists of various sections described in the
.Xr Mach-O 5
header.
.Sh NOTE
Core dumps are disabled by default under Darwin/Mac OS X.  To re-enable 
core dumps, a privileged user must do one of the following
.Pp
* Edit
.Pa /etc/launchd.conf 
or 
.Pa $HOME/.launchd.conf
and add a line specifying the limit
.Pa limit core unlimited
.Pp
* A privileged user can also enable cores with
.Pa launchctl limit core unlimited
.Pp
* A privileged user can also enable core files by using
.Xr ulimit 1
or 
.Xr limit 1
depending upon the shell.

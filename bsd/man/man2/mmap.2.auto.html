.Dt MMAP 2
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm mmap
.Nd allocate memory, or map files or devices into memory
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/mman.h
.Ft void *
.Fn mmap &quot;void *addr&quot; &quot;size_t len&quot; &quot;int prot&quot; &quot;int flags&quot; &quot;int fd&quot; &quot;off_t offset&quot;
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn mmap
system call causes the pages starting at
.Fa addr
and continuing for at most
.Fa len
bytes to be mapped from the object described by
.Fa fd ,
starting at byte offset
.Fa offset .
If
.Fa offset
or
.Fa len
is not a multiple of the pagesize, the mapped region may extend past the
specified range.
Any extension beyond the end of the mapped object will be zero-filled.
.Pp
The
.Fa addr
argument is used by the system to determine the starting address of the mapping,
and its interpretation is dependent on the setting of the MAP_FIXED flag.
If MAP_FIXED is specified in
.Fa flags ,
the system will try to place the mapping at the specified address, 
possibly removing a
mapping that already exists at that location.
If MAP_FIXED is not specified,
then the system will attempt to use the range of addresses starting at
.Fa addr
if they do not overlap any existing mappings,
including memory allocated by malloc(3) and other such allocators.
Otherwise,
the system will choose an alternate address for the mapping (using an implementation
dependent algorithm)
that does not overlap any existing
mappings.
In other words,
without MAP_FIXED the system will attempt to find an empty location in the address space if the specified address 
range has already been mapped by something else.
If
.Fa addr
is zero and MAP_FIXED is not specified,
then an address will be selected by the system so as not to overlap
any existing mappings in the address space.
In all cases,
the actual starting address of the region is returned.
If MAP_FIXED is specified,
a successful
.Fa mmap
deletes any previous mapping in the allocated address range.
Previous mappings are never deleted if MAP_FIXED is not specified.
.Pp
The protections (region accessibility) are specified in the
.Fa prot
argument by
.Em or Ns 'ing
the following values:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width PROT_WRITE -compact
.It Dv PROT_NONE
Pages may not be accessed.
.It Dv PROT_READ
Pages may be read.
.It Dv PROT_WRITE
Pages may be written.
.It Dv PROT_EXEC
Pages may be executed.
.El
.Pp
Note that, due to hardware limitations, on some platforms PROT_WRITE may
imply PROT_READ, and PROT_READ may imply PROT_EXEC.  Portable programs
should not rely on these flags being separately enforcable.
.Pp
The
.Fa flags
argument specifies the type of the mapped object, mapping options and
whether modifications made to the mapped copy of the page are private
to the process (copy-on-write) or are to be shared with other references.
Sharing, mapping type and options are specified in the
.Fa flags
argument by
.Em or Ns 'ing
the following values:
.Bl -tag -width MAP_HASSEMAPHORE
.It Dv MAP_ANONYMOUS
Synonym for
.Dv MAP_ANON.
.It Dv MAP_ANON
Map anonymous memory not associated with any specific file.
The
.Fa offset
argument is ignored.
Mac OS X specific: the file descriptor used for creating
.Dv MAP_ANON
regions can be used to pass some Mach VM flags, and can 
be specified as \-1 if no such flags are associated with 
the region.  Mach VM flags are defined in 
&lt;mach/vm_statistics.h&gt; and the ones that currently apply 
to 
.Nm mmap
are:
.Pp
VM_FLAGS_PURGABLE	to create Mach purgable (i.e. volatile) memory
.Pp
VM_MAKE_TAG(tag)	to associate an 8-bit tag with the region
.br
&lt;mach/vm_statistics.h&gt; defines some preset tags (with a VM_MEMORY_ prefix).
Users are encouraged to use tags between 240 and 255.
Tags are used by tools such as vmmap(1) to help identify specific memory regions.
.Pp
VM_FLAGS_SUPERPAGE_SIZE_*	to use superpages for the allocation. 
See &lt;mach/vm_statistics.h&gt; for supported architectures and sizes (or use
VM_FLAGS_SUPERPAGE_SIZE_ANY to have the kernel choose a size).
The specified size must be divisible by the superpage size (except for
VM_FLAGS_SUPERPAGE_SIZE_ANY), and if you use MAP_FIXED, the specified address
must be properly aligned. If the system cannot satisfy the request with superpages,
the call will fail. Note that currently, superpages are always wired and not
inherited by children of the process.
.It Dv MAP_FILE
Mapped from a regular file.  (This is
the default mapping type, and need not be specified.)
.It Dv MAP_FIXED
Do not permit the system to select a different address than the one
specified.
If the specified address cannot be used,
.Fn mmap
will fail.
If
.Dv MAP_FIXED
is specified,
.Fa addr
must be a multiple of the pagesize.
If a
.Dv MAP_FIXED
request is successful, the mapping established by
.Fn mmap
replaces any previous mappings for the process' pages in the range from
.Fa addr
to
.Fa addr
+
.Fa len .
Use of this option is discouraged.
.It Dv MAP_HASSEMAPHORE
Notify the kernel that the region may contain semaphores and that special
handling may be necessary.
.It Dv MAP_PRIVATE
Modifications are private (copy-on-write).
.It Dv MAP_SHARED
Modifications are shared.
.It Dv MAP_NOCACHE
Pages in this mapping are not retained in the kernel's memory cache.
If the system runs low on memory, pages in MAP_NOCACHE mappings will be among
the first to be reclaimed.
This flag is intended for mappings that have little locality and 
provides a hint to the kernel that pages in this mapping are unlikely to be needed
again in the near future.
.El
.Pp
Conforming applications must specify either MAP_PRIVATE or MAP_SHARED.
.Pp
The
.Xr close 2
system call does not unmap pages, see
.Xr munmap 2
for further information.
.Pp
The current design does not allow a process to specify the location of
swap space.
In the future we may define an additional mapping type,
.Dv MAP_SWAP ,
in which
the file descriptor argument specifies a file or device to which swapping
should be done.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion,
.Fn mmap
returns a pointer to the mapped region.
Otherwise, a value of
.Dv MAP_FAILED
is returned and
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn mmap
system call
will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EACCES
The flag
.Dv PROT_READ
was specified as part of the
.Fa prot
argument and
.Fa fd
was not open for reading.
The flags
.Dv MAP_SHARED
and
.Dv PROT_WRITE
were specified as part of the
.Fa flags
and
.Fa prot
argument and
.Fa fd
was not open for writing.
.It Bq Er EBADF
The
.Fa fd
argument
is not a valid open file descriptor.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
.Dv MAP_FIXED
was specified and the
.Fa addr
argument was not page aligned, or part of the desired address space
resides out of the valid address space for a user process.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
.Fa flags
does not include either MAP_PRIVATE or MAP_SHARED.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The
.Fa len
argument
was negative or zero. Historically, the system call would not return an error if the argument was zero. 
See other potential additional restrictions in the 
COMPATIBILITY section below. 
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The
.Fa offset
argument
was not page-aligned based on the page size as returned by getpagesize(3).
.It Bq Er ENODEV
.Dv MAP_ANON
has not been specified and the file
.Fa fd
refers to does not support mapping.
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
.Dv MAP_FIXED
was specified and the
.Fa addr
argument was not available.
.Dv MAP_FIXED
was specified and the address range specified exceeds the address space
limit for the process.
.Dv MAP_ANON
was specified and insufficient memory was available.
.It Bq Er ENXIO
Addresses in the specified range are invalid for 
.Fa fd .
.It Bq Er EOVERFLOW
Addresses in the specified range exceed the maximum offset
set for 
.Fa fd .
.El
.Sh LEGACY SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
.Fd #include &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;
.Pp
The include file
.In sys/types.h
is necessary.
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
.Fn mmap
now returns with
.Va errno
set to EINVAL in places that historically succeeded.
The rules have changed as follows:
.Bl -bullet
.It
The
.Fa flags
parameter must specify either MAP_PRIVATE or MAP_SHARED.
.It
The
.Fa len
parameter must not be 0.
.It
The
.Fa off
parameter must be a multiple of pagesize,
as returned by
.Fn sysconf .

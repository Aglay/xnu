.Sh NAME
.Nm mknod
.Nd make a special file node
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;
.Ft int
.Fo mknod
.Fa &quot;const char *path&quot;
.Fa &quot;mode_t mode&quot;
.Fa &quot;dev_t dev&quot;
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The device special file
.Fa path
is created with the major and minor
device numbers extracted from
.Fa mode .
The access permissions of
.Fa path
are constrained by the
.Xr umask 2
of the parent process.
.Pp
If
.Fa mode
indicates a block or character special file,
.Fa dev
is a configuration-dependent specification of a character or block
I/O device and the superblock of the device.  If
.Fa mode
does not indicate a block special or character special device,
.Fa dev
is ignored.
.Pp
.Fn Mknod
requires super-user privileges.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.
Otherwise, a value of -1 is returned and
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn Mknod
will fail and the file will be not created if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.\&quot; ==========
.It Bq Er EACCES
Search permission is denied for a component of the path prefix.
.\&quot; ==========
.It Bq Er EACCES
Write permission is denied for the parent directory.
.\&quot; ==========
.It Bq Er EDQUOT
The directory in which the entry for the new node
is being placed cannot be extended;
the user's quota of disk blocks on the file system
containing the directory has been exhausted.
.\&quot; ==========
.It Bq Er EDQUOT
The user's quota of inodes for the file system
on which the node is being created has been exhausted.
.\&quot; ==========
.It Bq Er EEXIST
The named file exists.
.\&quot; ==========
.It Bq Er EFAULT
.Fa Path
points outside the process's allocated address space.
.\&quot; ==========
.It Bq Er EINVAL
One or more of the arguments is invalid.
.\&quot; ==========
.It Bq Er EIO
An I/O error occurs while making the directory entry
or allocating the inode.
.\&quot; ==========
.It Bq Er ELOOP
Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating the pathname.
This is taken to be indicative of a looping symbolic link.
.\&quot; ==========
.It Bq Er ENAMETOOLONG
A component of a pathname exceeds 
.Dv {NAME_MAX}
characters or an entire path name exceeds 
.Dv {PATH_MAX}
characters.
.\&quot; ==========
.It Bq Er ENOENT
A component of the path prefix does not exist
or path is an empty string.
.\&quot; ==========
.It Bq Er ENOSPC
The directory in which the entry for the new node is being placed
cannot be extended,
because there is no space left on the file system containing the directory.
.\&quot; ==========
.It Bq Er ENOSPC
There are no free inodes on the file system
on which the node is being created.
.\&quot; ==========
.It Bq Er ENOTDIR
A component of the path prefix is not a directory.
.\&quot; ==========
.It Bq Er EPERM
The process's effective user ID is not super-user.
.\&quot; ==========
.It Bq Er EROFS
The created node would reside on a read-only file system.

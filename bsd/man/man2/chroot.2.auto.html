.Dt CHROOT 2
.Os BSD 4.2
.Sh NAME
.Nm chroot
.Nd change root directory
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
.Ft int
.Fn chroot &quot;const char *dirname&quot;
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fa Dirname
is the address of the pathname of a directory, terminated by an ASCII NUL.
.Fn Chroot
causes
.Fa dirname
to become the root directory,
that is, the starting point for path searches of pathnames
beginning with
.Ql / .
.Pp
In order for a directory to become the root directory
a process must have execute (search) access for that directory.
.Pp
If the program is not currently running with an altered root directory,
it should be noted that
.Fn chroot
has no effect on the process's current directory.
.Pp
If the program is already running with an altered root directory, the
process's current directory is changed to the same new root directory.
This prevents the current directory from being further up the directory
tree than the altered root directory.
.Pp
This call is restricted to the super-user.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise,
a value of -1 is returned and
.Va errno
is set to indicate an error.
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn Chroot
will fail and the root directory will be unchanged if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er ENOTDIR
A component of the path name is not a directory.
.It Bq Er ENAMETOOLONG
A component of a pathname exceeded 
.Dv {NAME_MAX}
characters, or an entire path name exceeded 
.Dv {PATH_MAX}
characters.
.It Bq Er ENOENT
The named directory does not exist.
.It Bq Er EACCES
Search permission is denied for any component of the path name.
.It Bq Er ELOOP
Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating the pathname.
.It Bq Er EFAULT
.Fa Path
points outside the process's allocated address space.
.It Bq Er EIO
An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the file system.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr chdir 2
.Sh WARNINGS

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn chroot
function call appeared in
.Bx 4.2 .

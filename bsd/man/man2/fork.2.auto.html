.Sh NAME
.Nm fork
.Nd create a new process
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
.Ft pid_t
.Fo fork
.Fa void
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn Fork
causes creation of a new process.
The new process (child process) is an exact copy of the
calling process (parent process) except for the following:
.Bl -bullet -offset indent
.It
The child process has a unique process ID.
.It
The child process has a different parent
process ID (i.e., the process ID of the parent process).
.It
The child process has its own copy of the parent's descriptors.
These descriptors reference the same underlying objects, so that,
for instance, file pointers in file objects are shared between
the child and the parent, so that an
.Xr lseek 2
on a descriptor in the child process can affect a subsequent
.Xr read
or
.Xr write
by the parent.
This descriptor copying is also used by the shell to
establish standard input and output for newly created processes
as well as to set up pipes.
.It
The child processes resource utilizations
are set to 0; see
.Xr setrlimit 2 .
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion,
.Fn fork
returns a value of 0 to the child process
and returns the process ID of the child process to the parent process.
Otherwise, a value of -1 is returned to the parent process,
no child process is created, and the global variable
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn Fork
will fail and no child process will be created if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.\&quot; ==========
.It Bq Er EAGAIN
The system-imposed limit
on the total number of processes under execution
would be exceeded.
This limit is configuration-dependent.
.\&quot; ==========
.It Bq Er EAGAIN
The system-imposed limit
.Dv MAXUPRC
.Pq Aq Pa sys/param.h
on the total number of
processes under execution by a single user would be exceeded.
.\&quot; ==========
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
There is insufficient swap space for the new process.
.El
.Sh LEGACY SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
.Fd #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
.Pp
The include file
.In sys/types.h
is necessary.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr execve 2 ,
.Xr sigaction 2 ,
.Xr wait 2 ,
.Xr compat 5
.Sh HISTORY
A
.Fn fork
function call appeared in
.At v6 .
.Sh CAVEATS
There are limits to what you can do in the child process.
To be totally safe you should restrict yourself to only
executing async-signal safe operations until such time
as one of the exec functions is called.  All APIs, including
global data symbols, in any framework or library should be 
assumed to be unsafe after a 
.Fn fork
unless explicitly documented to be safe or async-signal 
safe.  If you need to use these frameworks in the child 
process, you must exec.  In this situation it is reasonable 
to exec yourself.</pre>

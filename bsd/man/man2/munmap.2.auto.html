.Dt MUNMAP 2
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm munmap
.Nd remove a mapping
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;
.Ft int
.Fo munmap
.Fa &quot;void *addr&quot;
.Fa &quot;size_t len&quot;
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn munmap
system call
deletes the mappings for the specified address range,
causing further references to addresses within the range
to generate invalid memory references.
.Sh DIRTY PAGE HANDLING
How
.Fn munmap
handles a dirty page, depends on what type of memory is being unmapped:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width &quot;[System V Shared]&quot;
.It Bq Anonymous
If the memory is anonymous memory and if the last reference is going
away, then the contents are discarded by definition of anonymous memory.
.It Bq System V Shared
If the memory mapping was created using System V shared memory, then 
the contents persist until the System V memory region is destroyed or 
the system is rebooted.
.It Bq File mapping
If the mapping maps data from a file (MAP_SHARED), then the memory will 
eventually be written back to disk if it's dirty.  This will happen 
automatically at some point in the future (implementation dependent).
Note: to force the memory to be written back to the disk, use 
.Xr msync 2 .
.El
.Pp
If there are still other references to the memory when the munmap is 
done, then nothing is done to the memory itself and it may be swapped 
out if need be. The memory will continue to persist until the last 
reference goes away (except for System V shared memory in which case, 
see above).
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion,
.Nm munmap
returns zero.
Otherwise, a value of -1 is returned and
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn Munmap
will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.\&quot; ===========
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The
.Fa addr
parameter was not page aligned (i.e., a multiple of the page size).
.\&quot; ===========
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The
.Fa len
parameter was negative or zero.
.\&quot; ===========
.It Bq Er EINVAL
Some part of the region being unmapped is not part of the currently
valid address space.
.El
.Sh LEGACY SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
.Fd #include &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;
.Pp
The include file
.In sys/types.h
is necessary.
.Pp
.Ft int
.br
.Fo munmap
.Fa &quot;caddr_t addr&quot;
.Fa &quot;size_t len&quot;
.Fc ;
.Pp
The type of
.Fa addr
has changed.

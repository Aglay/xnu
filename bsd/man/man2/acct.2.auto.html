.Sh NAME
.Nm acct
.Nd enable or disable process accounting
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
.Ft int
.Fn acct &quot;const char *file&quot;
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn acct
call enables or disables the collection of system accounting
records.
If the argument
.Fa file
is a nil pointer, accounting is disabled.
If
.Fa file
is an
.Em existing
pathname (null-terminated), record collection is enabled and for 
every process initiated which terminates under normal
conditions an accounting record is appended to
.Fa file .
Abnormal conditions of termination are reboots
or other fatal system problems.
Records for processes which never terminate can not be
produced by
.Fn acct .
.Pp
For more information on the record structure used by
.Fn acct ,
see
.Pa /usr/include/sys/acct.h
and
.Xr acct 5 .
.Pp
This call is permitted only to the super-user.
.Sh NOTES
Accounting is automatically disabled when the file system the
accounting file resides on runs out of space; it is enabled when
space once again becomes available.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Rv -std acct
The file must exist and the call may be exercised only by the super-user.
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn acct
will fail if one of the following is true:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EPERM
The caller is not the super-user.
.It Bq Er ENOTDIR

.Dv {NAME_MAX}
characters, or an entire path name exceeded 
.Dv {PATH_MAX}
characters.
.It Bq Er ENOENT
The named file does not exist.
.It Bq Er EACCES
Search permission is denied for a component of the path prefix,
or the path name is not a regular file.
.It Bq Er ELOOP
Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating the pathname.
.It Bq Er EROFS
The named file resides on a read-only file system.
.It Bq Er EFAULT

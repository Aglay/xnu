.Sh NAME
.Nm open , openat
.Nd open or create a file for reading or writing
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.\&quot; OH??? .Fd #include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;
.Fd #include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;
.Ft int
.Fo open
.Fa &quot;const char *path&quot;
.Fa &quot;int oflag&quot;
.Fa &quot;...&quot;
.Fc
.Ft int
.Fn openat &quot;int fd&quot; &quot;const char *path&quot; &quot;int oflag&quot; &quot;...&quot;
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file name specified by
.Fa path
is opened
for reading and/or writing,
as specified by the argument
.Fa oflag ;
the file descriptor is returned to the calling process.
.Pp
The
.Fa oflag
argument may indicate that the file is to be
created if it does not exist (by specifying the
.Dv O_CREAT
flag).  In this case,
.Fn open
and
.Fn openat
require an additional argument
.Fa &quot;mode_t mode&quot; ;
the file is created with mode
.Fa mode
as described in
.Xr chmod 2
and modified by the process' umask value (see
.Xr umask 2 ) .
.Pp
The
.Fn openat
function is equivalent to the
.Fn open
function except in the case where the
.Fa path
specifies a relative path.
In this case the file to be opened is determined relative to the directory
associated with the file descriptor
.Fa fd
instead of the current working directory.
The
.Fa oflag
argument and the optional fourth argument correspond exactly to
the arguments for
.Fn open .
If
.Fn openat
is passed the special value
.Dv AT_FDCWD
in the
.Fa fd
argument, the current working directory is used
and the behavior is identical to a call to
.Fn open .
.Pp
The flags specified
for the
.Fa oflag
argument are formed by
.Em or Ns 'ing
the following values:
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
O_RDONLY	open for reading only
O_WRONLY	open for writing only
O_RDWR		open for reading and writing
O_NONBLOCK	do not block on open or for data to become available
O_APPEND	append on each write
O_CREAT		create file if it does not exist
O_TRUNC		truncate size to 0
O_EXCL		error if O_CREAT and the file exists
O_SHLOCK	atomically obtain a shared lock
O_EXLOCK	atomically obtain an exclusive lock
O_NOFOLLOW	do not follow symlinks
O_SYMLINK	allow open of symlinks
O_EVTONLY	descriptor requested for event notifications only
O_CLOEXEC	mark as close-on-exec
.Ed
.Pp
Opening a file with
.Dv O_APPEND
set causes each write on the file to be appended to the end.  If
.Dv O_TRUNC
is specified and the
file exists, the file is truncated to zero length.
If
.Dv O_EXCL
is set with
.Dv O_CREAT
and the file already
exists,
.Fn open
returns an error.
This may be used to implement a simple exclusive-access locking mechanism.
If
.Dv O_EXCL
is set with
.Dv O_CREAT
and the last component of the pathname is a symbolic link,
.Fn open
will fail even if the symbolic link points to a non-existent name.
.Pp
If the
.Dv O_NONBLOCK
flag is specified, do not wait for the device or file
to be ready or available.  If the
.Fn open
call would result
in the process being blocked for some reason
(e.g., waiting for carrier on a dialup line),
.Fn open
returns immediately.
This flag also has the effect of making all subsequent I/O
on the open file non-blocking.
.Pp
When opening a file, a lock with
.Xr flock 2
semantics can be obtained by setting
.Dv O_SHLOCK
for a shared lock, or
.Dv O_EXLOCK
for an exclusive lock.
If creating a file with
.Dv O_CREAT ,
the request for the lock will never fail
(provided that the underlying filesystem supports locking).
.Pp
If
.Dv O_NOFOLLOW
is used in the mask and the target file passed to
.Fn open
is a symbolic link then the
.Fn open
will fail.
.Pp
If
.Dv O_SYMLINK
is used in the mask and the target file passed to
.Fn open
is a symbolic link then the
.Fn open
will be for the symbolic link itself, not what it links to.
.Pp
The
.Dv O_EVTONLY
flag is only intended for monitoring a file for changes (e.g. kqueue). Note: when 
this flag is used, the opened file will not prevent an unmount 
of the volume that contains the file.
.Pp
The
.Dv O_CLOEXEC
flag causes the file descriptor to be marked as close-on-exec,
setting the
.Dv FD_CLOEXEC
flag.  The state of the file descriptor flags can be inspected
using the F_GETFD fcntl.  See
.Xr fcntl 2 .
.Pp
If successful,
.Fn open
returns a non-negative integer, termed a file descriptor.
It returns -1 on failure.
The file pointer (used to mark the current position within the file)
is set to the beginning of the file.
.Pp
When a new file is created,
it is given the group of the directory which contains it.
.Pp
The new descriptor is set to remain open across
.Xr execve
system calls; see
.Xr close 2
and
.Xr fcntl 2 .
.Pp
The system imposes a limit on the number of file descriptors
that can be held open simultaneously by one process.
.Xr Getdtablesize 2
returns the current system limit.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If successful,
.Fn open
returns a non-negative integer, termed a file descriptor.
It returns -1 on failure, and sets
.Va errno
to indicate the error.
